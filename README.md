## How to Access the Application

You have two options to view and interact with the Transformer Monitoring System:

### Option 1: Live Website (Recommended for Quick Access)

üåê **Visit the deployed application:**
[http://react-powergrid.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/transformers](http://react-powergrid.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/transformers)

This is a live deployment of the application that you can access immediately without any setup.

### Option 2: Run Frontend Code Locally (For Development)

üîß **Run the application on your local machine** (accessible at `http://localhost:5173`)

Follow the setup instructions below to run the frontend locally.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

#### Required Software

1. **Node.js** (version 18.0.0 or higher)

   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **npm** (version 9.0.0 or higher)
   - Usually comes with Node.js
   - Verify installation: `npm --version`

#### Development Tools (Recommended)

1. **Visual Studio Code**
   - Recommended extensions:
     - ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
     - Prettier - Code formatter
     - ESLint

### Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd client-side
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`

The development server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React 19.1.0
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwindcss
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Routing:** React Router
- **Development Server Port:** 5173

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 5173
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## list of implemented features

1. transformer page crud (add, edit, delete, view)
2. view inspections done on a transformer
3. baseline image for transformer(add, view, delete)
4. inspection page crud (add, edit, delete, view)
5. inspection image (add, view, delete)
6. compare baseline image with inspection image
7. pagination for inspection and transformer page(implemented in backend, which makes data loading efficient)
8. filters for both pages
9. message bar (success message, error message pop up)
10. mobile responsive design

## todo (known limitations for now)

1. filtering option should be shifted to backend (filters implemented on front end which makes the filter option to work only on the specific page)
2. sorting option should be shifted to backend.
